.SH NAME
pogo-token - Manage personal access tokens


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpogo token [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Manage personal access tokens stored in the system keyring for different Pogo servers.

.PP
Personal access tokens are used to authenticate with Pogo servers. They are
stored securely in your system's keyring/keychain, which means:
- Tokens persist across terminal sessions
- Tokens are encrypted at rest
- Each server has its own token
- Tokens are shared across all repositories on the same server

.PP
You typically receive a token from:
- Your system administrator when joining a team
- The server's web interface after logging in
- Another team member (share securely!)

.PP
The token is automatically used for all operations with the associated server.
