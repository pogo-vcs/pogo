.SH NAME
pogo-commit - Describe, push, and create a new change in one command


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpogo commit [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Commit is a convenience command that combines three operations:
1. Set/update the description for the current change (describe)
2. Push all changes to the server (push)
3. Create a new empty change for future work (new)

.PP
This command streamlines the common workflow of finishing work on the current
change and starting fresh. It's similar to 'git commit' but remember that in
Pogo, your work is continuously saved to the server rather than being staged
locally first.

.PP
The command will:
- Open an editor for the description (unless -m or --no-edit is used)
- Upload all your changes to the server
- Create a new change with the current change as parent
- Switch to the new change automatically
- Display the updated change history

.PP
This is ideal when you've completed a logical unit of work and want to start
on something new while preserving the current state.
