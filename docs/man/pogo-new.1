.SH NAME
pogo-new - Create a new change based on one or more parent changes


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpogo new [parent-change-names...] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a new change (similar to a commit in Git) based on one or more parent changes.

.PP
This command is used when you're ready to start working on something new after
completing your current work. It creates a fresh change that builds upon the
specified parent(s).

.PP
Key behaviors:
- If no parents specified, uses the current change as parent
- Automatically switches to the new change after creation
- The previous change becomes read-only to preserve history
- Multiple parents create a merge (combining work from different branches)

.PP
By default, this command pushes local changes to the current change before
creating a new one. Use --keep-changes to skip this push and instead add your
local modifications to the newly created change.

.PP
Typical workflow:
1. Describe your planned changes with 'pogo describe'
2. Make your code changes
3. Push regularly with 'pogo push' to save your work
4. When done, create a new change with 'pogo new' to start fresh
