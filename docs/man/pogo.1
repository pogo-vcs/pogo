.SH NAME
pogo - A centralized version control system that is simple and easy to use


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpogo [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Pogo is a centralized version control system designed to be straightforward and efficient.

.PP
Unlike Git, Pogo uses a centralized server as the single source of truth for all your data.
It features an easy-to-use CLI, a simple web UI, and robust support for both text and binary files.
Conflicts are treated as first-class citizens - they can be pushed to the remote and resolved later.

.PP
Key concepts:
- Changes: The fundamental unit of work, similar to commits in Git
- Bookmarks: Named references to specific changes (like tags/branches in Git)
- No named branches: Create branches by adding multiple children to a change
- Automatic naming: Changes are automatically named with memorable identifiers
