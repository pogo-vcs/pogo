.SH NAME
pogo-edit - Switch to a different change for editing


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpogo edit  [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Switch your working directory to a different change for editing.

.PP
This command downloads all files from the specified change and replaces your
current working directory contents with them. It's similar to 'git checkout'
but in Pogo's centralized model.

.PP
Important notes:
- Any uncommitted local changes will be pushed to the current change before switching
- The change you switch to becomes your new working change
- You can edit any change, even if it has children (though pushing will require --force)
- Files in .pogoignore are not affected by this operation

.PP
Use this command to:
- Switch between different lines of development
- Go back to an earlier version to fix a bug
- Review someone else's changes
- Start working from a different base

.PP
This command pushes any changes before running.
